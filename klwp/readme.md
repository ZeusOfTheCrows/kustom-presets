### Wood Panelling

My entry to the /r/androidthemes monthly contest

inspired by retro car header units, and VCRs. the central display shows the  current song, or three notifications + wifi ssid if no music is playing. the line under the music is track percentage. the needle meter is  battery, the bars on the left and right are signal, wifi, and bluetooth  speaker battery (if applicable). the icons are bluetooth on/connected,  charging/fast, data, and wifi on/connected.
